#### Project 1 : Income Prediction: RandomforestClassifier Algorithm

In this project, I employ the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to predict income based on a variety of critical factors, including age, education level, gender, total working hours, and more. This sophisticated approach enables me to make precise financial forecasts and empowers me to take informed steps towards achieving my financial objectives

#### Project 2 : Face Recognition for Adult vs Children: Tensorflow Algorithm

The project revolved around image classification using TensorFlow, aiming to build a well-tuned machine learning model with high accuracy. It successfully achieved a training accuracy and validation accuracy of over 95%, all within the TensorFlow framework. To further enhance the model's performance, several strategies and recommendations were implemented, including callback functions, data augmentation, dropout regularization, and the exploration of transfer learning with TensorFlow. This project exemplified the power of TensorFlow in image classification and demonstrated the importance of continuous monitoring and optimization in machine learning projects.
