#### Project 1 : Income Prediction - RandomforestClassifier Algorithm

In this project, I employ the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to predict income based on a variety of critical factors, including age, education level, gender, total working hours, and more. This sophisticated approach enables me to make precise financial forecasts and empowers me to take informed steps towards achieving my financial objectives

#### Project 2 : Face Recognition for Adult vs Children - Tensorflow Algorithm

The project revolved around image classification using TensorFlow, aiming to build a well-tuned machine learning model with high accuracy. It successfully achieved a training accuracy and validation accuracy of over 95%, all within the TensorFlow framework. To further enhance the model's performance, several strategies and recommendations were implemented, including callback functions, data augmentation, dropout regularization, and the exploration of transfer learning with TensorFlow. This project exemplified the power of TensorFlow in image classification and demonstrated the importance of continuous monitoring and optimization in machine learning projects.

#### Project 3 : Organic and Non-Organic Waste Classification -  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
In collaboration with Bangkit Academy 2023 and supported by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka, our capstone project focuses on "Organic and Non-Organic Waste Classification using Machine Learning." This project addresses the pressing global issue of waste management and environmental sustainability by developing an innovative machine learning solution.

The primary goal of our project is to create a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying waste materials into two categories: organic and non-organic. This classification process is vital for efficient recycling and waste disposal practices.

Our approach leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques to automate the waste classification process. By utilizing image recognition and classification methods, we aim to empower waste management facilities, recycling centers, and environmental organizations with a tool that can quickly and accurately identify the nature of waste materials.

## Data Analytics & Data Visualization

#### DA Project 1 : The Dynamic of Covid-19 Indonesia

Through this project, I created a visualization dashboard about the dynamics of the Covid-19 movement in Indonesia from February 2020 to August 2022. I did this visualization through exploratory data analysis collaboration using Microsoft Excel with functions such as pivot tables and others to get analysis results. I then visualized the results of this analysis through tableau tools, which then produced this dashboard.
